- ⚡ Fun fact: When I am not diving into data, you will likely find me sewing! I enjoy creating custom pieces and experimenting with different fabrics.
  Much like data analysis, sewing requires precision, creativity and a keen eye for detail- it's all about stitching things together to create something beautiful.
